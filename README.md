# ServiceBase

ServiceBase is my personal library with all common used bits & parts I use for building web services with .NET 5

[![CI develop](https://github.com/aruss/ServiceBase/actions/workflows/develop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aruss/ServiceBase/actions/workflows/develop.yml)

### Platform

ServiceBase is built against NET 5 using the RTM tooling that ships with Visual Studio 2019. This is the only configuration I support on the issue tracker.

### How to build

-   Install [.NET 5](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/current)
-   Use [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to build it

The scripts `coverage.sh` and `deploy.sh` run on WSL

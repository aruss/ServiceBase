ServiceBase is my personal library with all common used bits & parts I use for building web services with .NET Core

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wacmh1819dmc70b6/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/aruss81994/servicebase/branch/master)

### Platform

ServiceBase is built against NET Core 2.2 using the RTM tooling that ships with Visual Studio 2017. This is the only configuration I support on the issue tracker.

### How to build

* [Install](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/current) .NET Core 2.2

## Documentation

There is a [example](./examples/Plugins) project that utilizes most of features you can dig in.

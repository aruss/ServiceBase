# ServiceBase

ServiceBase is my personal library with all common used bits & parts I use for building web services with .NET 6

[![CI develop](https://github.com/aruss/ServiceBase/actions/workflows/develop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aruss/ServiceBase/actions/workflows/develop.yml)

### Platform

ServiceBase is built against NET 6 using the RTM tooling that ships with Visual Studio 2022. This is the only configuration I support on the issue tracker.

### How to build

-   Install [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
-   Use [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to build it
